# Portfolio

I created a dynamic and responsive portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and experiences in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. The HTML structure provides a solid foundation, while the CSS adds style and design elements, ensuring the site looks professional across all devices. JavaScript enhances interactivity, including features such as smooth scrolling. This portfolio effectively highlights my abilities in web development and design.
